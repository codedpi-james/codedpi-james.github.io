      <h2>Our digital on-board marketplace: an essential response to COVID-19</h2>
        <p>
          Since 2019, <a href="http://www.gategroup.com">Gate Group</a> and <a href="http://www.blackswan.com">Black Swan</a> have been working together to develop a new digital retail platform called, currently called ‘ePAX’, for direct use by passengers in the cabin, during flight.
        </p>
        <p>
          We understand that COVID-19 has left airlines in a challenging place, which is why we're now launching ePAX as a new zero-cost trial; offering hygiene-friendly onboard digital retail, that will help our partners improve the safety of the in-flight shopping experience and boost their revenues.
        </p>
        <p>
          We look to the future, to recovery, and we see technology as a key part of this: both in terms of ensuring crew and passengers feel safer when they fly, and by enabling - or even enhancing - services that people enjoy when they travel. Our ultimate mission being to provide passengers and businesses the greatest choice, control and convenience throughout the travel experience.
        </p>
